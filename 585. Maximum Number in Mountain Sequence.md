### 585. Maximum Number in Mountain Sequence

Medium

Given a mountain sequence of `n` integers which increase firstly and then decrease, find the mountain top.

### Example

Given `nums` = `[1, 2, 4, 8, 6, 3]` return `8`
Given `nums` = `[10, 9, 8, 7]`, return `10`



```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param nums: a mountain sequence which increase firstly and then decrease
    @return: then mountain top
    """
    def mountainSequence(self, nums):
        # Binary Search
        # Check input
        if nums == [] or nums is None:
            return 0

        start = 0
        end = len(nums) - 1
        
        # As usual, leave two items in the end
        while start + 1 < end:
            m1 = start + (end - start) // 2
            m2 = end - (end - m1) // 2
            if nums[m1] < nums[m2]:
                # When 1st num has to be in 1st mountain
                start = m1 + 1
            elif nums[m1] > nums[m2]:
                # When 2nd nums has to be in 2nd mountain
                end = m2 - 1
            else:
                # When the twist is in between
                start = m1
                end = m2
        return max(nums[start], nums[end])
```
