### 114. Unique Paths

###easy

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid.

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.

How many possible unique paths are there?

### Example

Given m = `3` and n = `3`, return `6`.
Given m = `4` and n = `5`, return `35`.

### Notice

*m* and *n* will be at most 100.

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param m: positive integer (1 <= m <= 100)
    @param n: positive integer (1 <= n <= 100)
    @return: An integer
    """	
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        dic = {}
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dic[(i, j)] = 1
                    continue
                dic[(i, j)] = dic[(i-1, j)] + dic[(i, j-1)]
        return dic[(m-1, n-1)]  # has to -1, or it'll go outta bound
                    
         
```
