### 437. Copy Books

Given *n* books and the *i*th book has `A[i]` pages. You are given *k* people to copy the *n* books.

*n* books list in a row and each person can claim a continous range of the *n* books. For example one copier can copy the books from *i*th to *j*th continously, but he can not copy the 1st book, 2nd book and 4th book (without 3rd book).

They start copying books at the same time and they all cost 1 minute to copy 1 page of a book. What's the best strategy to assign books so that the slowest copier can finish at earliest time?

### Example

Given array A = `[3,2,4]`, k = `2`.

Return `5`( First person spends 5 minutes to copy book 1 and book 2 and second person spends 4 minutes to copy book 3. )

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param pages: an array of integers
    @param k: An integer
    @return: an integer
    """
    def copyBooks(self, pages, k):
        # Binary search
        if not pages:
            return 0
        start = max(pages)  # 1 people 1 book
        end = sum(pages)    # all books 1 people
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            # If the mid time needs less people, means cur_time is too big
            if self.get_least_people(mid, pages) <= k:
                end = mid
            else:
                start = mid
        if self.get_least_people(start, pages) <= k:
            return start
        if self.get_least_people(end, pages) <= k:
            return end
        return 0
    
    def get_least_people(self, max_time, pages):
        num_people = 0
        cur_time = 0
        for page in pages:
            if cur_time + page > max_time:
                num_people += 1
                cur_time = 0
            cur_time += page
        # The total time could be less than max, so res + 1
        return num_people + 1  

```
