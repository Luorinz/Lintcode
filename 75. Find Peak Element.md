###  75. Find Peak Element

###medium

There is an integer array which has the following features:

- The numbers in adjacent positions are different.
- A[0] < A[1] && A[A.length - 2] > A[A.length - 1].

We define a position P is a peak if:

```
A[P] > A[P-1] && A[P] > A[P+1]
```

Find a peak element in this array. Return the index of the peak.

### Example

Given `[1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6]`

Return index `1` (which is number 2) or `6` (which is number 7)

### Challenge

Time complexity O(logN)

### Notice

- It's guaranteed the array has at least one peak.
- The array may contain multiple peeks, find any of them.
- The array has at least 3 numbers in it.

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param A: An integers array.
    @return: return any of peek positions.
    """
    def findPeak(self, A):
        # O(logn)
        
        start = 1
        end = len(A) - 2
        
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            if A[mid - 1] > A[mid]:
                # on the right
                end = mid
            elif A[mid] < A[mid + 1]:
                # on the left
                start = mid
            else:
                # On the peak
                return mid
                
        if A[start] > A[end]:
            return start
        else:
            return end
```
