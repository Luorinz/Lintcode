### 254. Drop Eggs

There is a building of `n` floors. If an egg drops from the *k* th floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break.

You're given two eggs, Find *k* while minimize the number of drops for the worst case. Return the number of drops in the worst case.

### Example

Given n = `10`, return `4`.
Given n = `100`, return `14`.

### Clarification

For n = 10, a naive way to find *k* is drop egg from 1st floor, 2nd floor ... kth floor. But in this worst case (k = 10), you have to drop 10 times.

Notice that you have two eggs, so you can drop at 4th, 7th & 9th floor, in the worst case (for example, k = 9) you have to drop 4 times.

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: An integer
    @return: The sum of a and b
    """
    def dropEggs(self, n):
        # Math problem
        # Count 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +.. + x >= n
        res = 1
        temp = 1
        while temp < n:
            res += 1
            temp += res
        return res
```
