### 578. Lowest Common Ancestor III

###medium

Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.
The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.
Return `null` if LCA does not exist.

### Example

For the following binary tree:

```
  4
 / \
3   7
   / \
  5   6
```

LCA(3, 5) = `4`

LCA(5, 6) = `7`

LCA(6, 7) = `7`

### Notice

node A or node B may not exist in tree.
