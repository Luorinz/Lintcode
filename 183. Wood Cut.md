### 183. Wood Cut

Given n pieces of wood with length `L[i]` (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.

### Example

For `L=[232, 124, 456]`, `k=7`, return `114`.

### Challenge

O(n log Len), where Len is the longest length of the wood.

### Notice

You couldn't cut wood into float length.

If you couldn't get >= *k* pieces, return `0`.

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param L: Given n pieces of wood with length L[i]
    @param k: An integer
    @return: The maximum length of the small pieces
    """
    def woodCut(self, L, k):
        # Binary search
        if not L:
            return 0
        start = 1   # wood has to be cut to the min int
        end = max(L)
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            if self.get_pieces(mid, L) >= k: # could have more pieces
                start = mid
            else:
                end = mid
        if self.get_pieces(end, L) >= k:
            return end
        if self.get_pieces(start, L) >= k:
            return start
        return 0
    
    def get_pieces(self, length, L):
        pieces = 0
        for l in L:
            pieces += l // length
        return pieces
```
