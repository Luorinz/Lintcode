### 680. Split String

###medium

Give a string, you can choose to split the string after one character or two adjacent characters, and make the string to be composed of only one character or two characters. Output all possible results.

### Example

Given the string `"123"`
return `[["1","2","3"],["12","3"],["1","23"]]`

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param: : a string to be split
    @return: all possible split string array
    """

    def splitString(self, s):
        # DFS
        res = []
        path = []
        self.helper(s, path, res)
        return res
    
    def helper(self, s, path, res):
        if s == "": # Reached bottom level
            res.append(path.copy())
            
        for i in range(2):  # take first two letters into path
            if i + 1 <=  len(s):
                path.append(s[:i+1])
                self.helper(s[i+1:], path, res) # The string varies with the current path
                path.pop()
                
```
