### 615. Course Schedule

###medium

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

### Example

Given n = `2`, prerequisites = `[[1,0]]`
Return `true`

Given n = `2`, prerequisites = `[[1,0],[0,1]]`
Return `false`

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    """
    @param: numCourses: a total of n courses
    @param: prerequisites: a list of prerequisite pairs
    @return: true if can finish all courses or false
    """
    def canFinish(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        # Use BFS & Topological Sort
        
        # Initialization, store them in dic
        # dic stores the edge of graph, degree stores the point of graph
        dic = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}
        degree = [0 for i in range(numCourses)]    # Store the indegree
        for i,j in prerequisites:
            dic[j].append(i)    # the value are all nodes connected to it
            degree[i] += 1
            
        # Add those 0 indegree item in the queue
        queue = deque()
        count = 0 
        for i in range(len(degree)):
            if degree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            count += 1  # Found a zero indegree node
            for i in dic[node]:
                degree[i] -= 1
                if degree[i] == 0:
                    queue.append(i) # Add the new zero indegree node
        
        return count == numCourses
        

```
