### 40. Implement Queue by Two Stacks

###medium

As the title described, you should only use two stacks to implement a queue's actions.

The queue should support `push(element)`, `pop()` and `top()` where pop is pop the first(a.k.a front) element in the queue.

Both pop and top methods should return the value of first element.

### Example

```
push(1)
pop()     // return 1
push(2)
push(3)
top()     // return 2
pop()     // return 2
```

### Challenge

implement it by two stacks, do not use any other data structure and push, pop and top should be O(1) by *AVERAGE*.

```python
class MyQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.s1 = []
        self.s2 = []

    def push(self, element):
        self.s1.append(element)

    def pop(self):
        # Reverse the current order
        # doesn't matter the s1 is empty, since s2 is earlier than s1 if exists
        if self.s2 == []:
            while self.s1:
                self.s2.append(self.s1.pop())
        return self.s2.pop()

    def top(self):
        if self.s2 == []:
            while self.s1:
                self.s2.append(self.s1.pop())
        return self.s2[len(self.s2) - 1]
```
