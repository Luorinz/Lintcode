### 201. Segment Tree Build

The structure of Segment Tree is a binary tree which each node has two attributes `start` and `end` denote an segment / interval.

*start* and *end* are both integers, they should be assigned in following rules:

- The root's *start* and *end* is given by `build` method.
- The left child of node A has `start=A.left, end=(A.left + A.right) / 2`.
- The right child of node A has `start=(A.left + A.right) / 2 + 1, end=A.right`.
- if *start* equals to *end*, there will be no children for this node.

Implement a `build` method with two parameters *start* and *end*, so that we can create a corresponding segment tree with every node has the correct *start* and *end* value, return the root of this segment tree.

### Example

Given `start=0, end=3`. The segment tree will be:

```
               [0,  3]
             /        \
      [0,  1]           [2, 3]
      /     \           /     \
   [0, 0]  [1, 1]     [2, 2]  [3, 3]
```

Given `start=1, end=6`. The segment tree will be:

```
               [1,  6]
             /        \
      [1,  3]           [4,  6]
      /     \           /     \
   [1, 2]  [3,3]     [4, 5]   [6,6]
   /    \           /     \
[1,1]   [2,2]     [4,4]   [5,5]
```

### Clarification

Segment Tree (a.k.a Interval Tree) is an advanced data structure which can support queries like:

- which of these intervals contain a given point
- which of these points are in a given interval
