### 612. K Closest Points

###medium

Given some `points` and an `origin` point in two-dimensional space, find `k` points which are nearest to the `origin`.
Return these points sorted by distance, if they are same in distance, sorted by the x-axis, and if they are same in the x-axis, sorted by y-axis.

### Example

Given points = `[[4,6],[4,7],[4,4],[2,5],[1,1]]`, origin = `[0, 0]`, k = `3`
return `[[1,1],[2,5],[4,4]]`

```python
"""
Definition for a point.
class Point:
    def __init__(self, a=0, b=0):
        self.x = a
        self.y = b
"""

class Solution:
    """
    @param points: a list of points
    @param origin: a point
    @param k: An integer
    @return: the k closest points
    """
    def kClosest(self, points, origin, k):
        # Use small heap
        import heapq
        heap = []
        for point in points:
            d = self.get_distance(point, origin)
            # Python will automatically compare each item in the tuple
            # first distance, then x, then y
            if len(heap) < k:   
                heapq.heappush(heap, (-d, -point.x, -point.y))
            else:
                heapq.heappushpop(heap, (-d, -point.x, -point.y))
        res = []
        while heap:
            _, tempx, tempy = heapq.heappop(heap)
            res.append(Point(-tempx, -tempy))   # Descending Order
        res.reverse()   # Convert it to ascending order
        return res
        
    def get_distance(self, a, b):
        return (a.x - b.x) ** 2 + (a.y - b.y) ** 2
