### 598. Zombie in Matrix

Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall `2`, a zombie `1` or people `0` (the number zero, one, two).Zombies can turn the nearest people(up/down/left/right) into zombies every day, but can not through wall. How long will it take to turn all people into zombies? Return `-1` if can not turn all people into zombies.

### Example

Given a matrix:

```
0 1 2 0 0
1 0 0 2 1
0 1 0 0 0
```

return `2`

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param grid: a 2D integer grid
    @return: an integer
    """
    def zombie(self, grid):
        # BFS O(m*n)
        # Use the sum of zombies and the sum of walls to identify if it's failed
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return -1
        from collections import deque
        sum_zombie = 0
        sum_wall = 0
        queue = deque()
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[i])):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    sum_zombie += 1
                    queue.append([i, j, 0])
                if grid[i][j] == 2:
                    sum_wall += 1
        days = 0
        DIRECTION = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
        while queue:
            cur = queue.popleft()
            for i, j in DIRECTION:
                if 0 <= cur[0] + i < len(grid) and 0 <= cur[1] + j < len(grid[0]):
                    if grid[cur[0] + i][cur[1] + j] == 0:
                        queue.append([cur[0] + i, cur[1] + j, cur[2] + 1])
                        grid[cur[0] + i][cur[1] + j] = 1
                        sum_zombie += 1
            if not queue:
                days = cur[2]
        if sum_zombie + sum_wall != len(grid) * len(grid[0]):
            return -1
        return days
