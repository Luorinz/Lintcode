### 662. Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

### Example

n = 10, I pick 4 (but you don't know)

Return 4. Correct !

```python
"""
The guess API is already defined for you.
@param num, your guess
@return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
you can call Guess.guess(num)
"""


class Solution:
    # @param {int} n an integer
    # @return {int} the number you guess
    def guessNumber(self, n):
        left, right = 1, n
        while left + 1< right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            res = Guess.guess(mid)
            if res == 0:
                return mid
            if res < 0:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid
        if Guess.guess(left) == 0:
            return left
        return right
        
```
