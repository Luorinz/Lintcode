### 155. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

###easy

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

### Example

Given a binary tree as follow:

```
  1
 / \ 
2   3
   / \
  4   5  
```

The minimum depth is `2`.

```python
"""
Definition of TreeNode:
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left, self.right = None, None
"""

class Solution:
    """
    @param root: The root of binary tree
    @return: An integer
    """
    def minDepth(self, root):
        if root is None:
            return 0
        return self.helper(root)
    
    def helper(self, root):
        if root is None:    # reach bottom
            return float('inf') 
        if root.left is None and root.right is None:    # reach leaf
            return 1    # have to be 1 or it'll reach inf
        left_depth = self.helper(root.left)
        right_depth = self.helper(root.right)
        cur_depth = min(left_depth, right_depth) + 1
        

        return cur_depth

```
