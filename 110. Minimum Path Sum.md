### 110. Minimum Path Sum

###easy

Given a **m x n** grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which **\*minimizes*** the sum of all numbers along its path.

### Notice

You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param grid: a list of lists of integers
    @return: An integer, minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path
    """
    def minPathSum(self, grid):
        dic = {}
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[i])):
                if i == 0 and j == 0:
                    dic[(i, j)] = grid[i][j]
                elif i == 0:
                    dic[(i, j)] = dic[(i,j-1)] + grid[i][j]
                elif j == 0:
                    dic[(i, j)] = dic[(i-1,j)] + grid[i][j]
                else:
                    dic[(i, j)] = min(dic[(i-1, j)], dic[(i, j-1)]) + grid[i][j]
        return dic[(i, j)]
                    
        
```
