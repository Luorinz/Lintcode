### 76. Longest Increasing Subsequence

###Medium

Given a sequence of integers, find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS).

You code should return the length of the LIS.

### Example

For `[5, 4, 1, 2, 3]`, the LIS is `[1, 2, 3]`, return `3`
For `[4, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7]`, the LIS is `[2, 4, 5, 7]`, return `4`

### Challenge

Time complexity O(n^2) or O(nlogn)

### Clarification

What's the definition of longest increasing subsequence?

- The longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.

  ```python
  class Solution:
      """
      @param nums: An integer array
      @return: The length of LIS (longest increasing subsequence)
      """
      def longestIncreasingSubsequence(self, nums):
          if not nums:
              return 0
          dp = [1] * len(nums) # stands for LIS of cur num
          for i in range(len(nums)):
              for j in range(i):
                  if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                      # Find the max res
                      dp[i] = max(dp[j]+1, dp[i])
          return max(dp)
  
  ```
