### 116. Jump Game

###Medium

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

### Example

A = `[2,3,1,1,4]`, return `true`.

A = `[3,2,1,0,4]`, return `false`.

### Notice

This problem have two method which is `Greedy` and `Dynamic Programming`.

The time complexity of `Greedy` method is `O(n)`.

The time complexity of `Dynamic` Programming method is `O(n^2)`.

We manually set the small data set to allow you pass the test in both ways. This is just to let you learn how to use this problem in dynamic programming ways. If you finish it in dynamic programming ways, you can try greedy method to make it accept again.

```python
class Solution_1:
    def canJump(self, A):
        # DP
        if not A:
            return False
        dp = [1] + [0]*(len(A) - 1) # Represent if each digit is reachable
        for i in range(len(A)):
            if dp[i] == 0:  # Cannot reach
                continue
            for j in range(A[i]):
                if i+j+1 < len(A):
                    dp[i+j+1] = 1   # Mark each digit reachable
        return dp[-1] == 1

class Solution:
    def canJump(self, A):
        # Greedy
        if not A:
            return False
        n = 0   # Represents the fartherst reachable digit
        for i in range(len(A)):
            if i > n:   # If not reachable, return false
                return False
            n = max(A[i] + i, n)    # update the fartherst digit reachable
        return True
```
