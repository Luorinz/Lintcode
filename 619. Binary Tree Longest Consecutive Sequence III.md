### 619. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence III

###medium

It's follow up problem for [`Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence II`](http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/binary-tree-longest-consecutive-sequence-ii/)

Given a `k-ary tree`, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.
The path could be start and end at any node in the tree

### Example

An example of test data: k-ary tree `5<6<7<>,5<>,8<>>,4<3<>,5<>,3<>>>`, denote the following structure:

```
     5
   /   \
  6     4
 /|\   /|\
7 5 8 3 5 3

Return 5, // 3-4-5-6-7
```

```python
"""
Definition for a multi tree node.
class MultiTreeNode(object):
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        children = [] # children is a list of MultiTreeNode
"""


class Solution:
    # @param {MultiTreeNode} root the root of k-ary tree
    # @return {int} the length of the longest consecutive sequence path
    def longestConsecutive3(self, root):
        max_len, _, _ = self.helper(root)
        return max_len
    
    def helper(self, root):
        if root is None:
            return 0, 0, 0
            
        cur_ascend = 0  # the length of ascending path
        cur_descend = 0 # the length of descending path
        cur_len = 0
        
        for child in root.children:
            temp_len, temp_ascend, temp_descend = self.helper(child)
            cur_len = max(cur_len, temp_len)
            if root.val + 1 == child.val:
                cur_ascend = max(cur_ascend, temp_ascend + 1)   # has to +1
            if root.val - 1 == child.val:
                cur_descend = max(cur_descend, temp_descend + 1)
        
        max_len = max(cur_ascend + cur_descend + 1, cur_len)
        return max_len, cur_ascend, cur_descend
```
