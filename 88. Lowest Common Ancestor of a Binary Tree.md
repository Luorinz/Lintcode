### 88. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

###easy

Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.

### Example

For the following binary tree:

```
  4
 / \
3   7
   / \
  5   6
```

LCA(3, 5) = `4`

LCA(5, 6) = `7`

LCA(6, 7) = `7`

### Notice

Assume two nodes are exist in tree.

```python
"""
Definition of TreeNode:
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left, self.right = None, None
"""


class Solution:
    """
    @param: root: The root of the binary search tree.
    @param: A: A TreeNode in a Binary.
    @param: B: A TreeNode in a Binary.
    @return: Return the least common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.

        if root == A or root == B:  # Found A or B
            return root # current LCA is the node itself

        left_result = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, A, B)
        right_result = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, A, B)
        
        if left_result and right_result:    # cur node is LCA
            return root
