###  56. Two Sum

###easy

Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function `twoSum` should return *indices* of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are zero-based.

### Example

numbers=`[2, 7, 11, 15]`, target=`9`

return `[0, 1]`

### Challenge

Either of the following solutions are acceptable:

- O(n) Space, O(nlogn) Time
- O(n) Space, O(n) Time

### Notice

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param numbers: An array of Integer
    @param target: target = numbers[index1] + numbers[index2]
    @return: [index1, index2] (index1 < index2)
    """
    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
        # hashmap
        dic = {}
        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] in dic:   # if found, then return 
                return [dic[numbers[i]], i]
            dic[target - numbers[i]] = i    # store the corresponding item first
        return []
```
