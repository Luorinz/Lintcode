### 434. Number of Islands II

Given a n,m which means the row and column of the 2D matrix and an array of pair A( size k). Originally, the 2D matrix is all 0 which means there is only sea in the matrix. The list pair has k operator and each operator has two integer A[i].x, A[i].y means that you can change the grid matrix[A[i].x][A[i].y] from sea to island. Return how many island are there in the matrix after each operator.

### Example

Given `n` = `3`, `m` = `3`, array of pair A = `[(0,0),(0,1),(2,2),(2,1)]`.

return `[1,1,2,2]`.

### Notice

0 is represented as the sea, 1 is represented as the island. If two 1 is adjacent, we consider them in the same island. We only consider up/down/left/right adjacent.
