### 616. Course Schedule II

###medium

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

### Example

Given n = `2`, prerequisites = `[[1,0]]`
Return `[0,1]`

Given n = 4, prerequisites = `[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]`
Return `[0,1,2,3]` or `[0,2,1,3]`

```python
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    """
    @param: numCourses: a total of n courses
    @param: prerequisites: a list of prerequisite pairs
    @return: the course order
    """
    def findOrder(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        # Topological sort using BFS
        
        # Store them into dic
        dic = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}
        degree = [0] * numCourses
        for i, j in prerequisites:
            dic[j].append(i)
            degree[i] += 1
            
        # Initialize the queue
        queue = deque()
        for i in range(len(degree)):
            if degree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)
        res = []
        
        # BFS
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            res.append(node)    # Order doesn't matter here. Only total count matter.
            for i in dic[node]:
                degree[i] -= 1
                if degree[i] == 0:
                    queue.append(i)
        if len(res) == numCourses:
            return res
            
        return []
