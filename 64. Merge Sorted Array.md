### 64. Merge Sorted Array

###easy

Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

### Example

A = `[1, 2, 3, empty, empty]`, B = `[4, 5]`

After merge, A will be filled as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

### Notice

You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to *m* + *n*) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are *m*and *n* respectively.

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param: A: sorted integer array A which has m elements, but size of A is m+n
    @param: m: An integer
    @param: B: sorted integer array B which has n elements
    @param: n: An integer
    @return: nothing
    """
    def mergeSortedArray(self, A, m, B, n):
        # merge sort reversely
        pA = m - 1
        pB = n - 1
        ind = m + n - 1
        while pA >= 0 and pB >= 0:
            if A[pA] > B[pB]:
                A[ind] = A[pA]
                ind -= 1
                pA -= 1
            else:
                A[ind] = B[pB]
                ind -= 1
                pB -= 1
        while pA >= 0:
            A[ind] = A[pA]
            ind -= 1
            pA -= 1
        while pB >= 0:
            A[ind] = B[pB]
            ind -= 1
            pB -= 1
        return A
```
