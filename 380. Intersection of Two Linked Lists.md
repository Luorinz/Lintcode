### 380. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

### Example

The following two linked lists:

```
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
```

begin to intersect at node c1.

### Challenge

Your code should preferably run in O(*n*) time and use only O(*1*) memory.

### Notice

- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

  ```python
  """
  Definition of ListNode
  class ListNode(object):
      def __init__(self, val, next=None):
          self.val = val
          self.next = next
  """
  
  class Solution:
      def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
          # double ptrs
          # Find identical length then start searching
          # On+m time
          p1, p2 = headA, headB
          l1, l2 = 0, 0
          while p1 is not None:
              p1 = p1.next
              l1 += 1
          while p2 is not None:
              p2 = p2.next
              l2 += 1
          while l1 > l2:
              headA = headA.next
              l1 -= 1
          while l1 < l2:
              headB = headB.next
              l2 -= 1
          while headA and headA.val != headB.val:
              headA = headA.next
              headB = headB.next
  
          return headA
  ```
