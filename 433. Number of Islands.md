### 433. Number of Islands

### easy

Given a boolean 2D matrix, `0` is represented as the sea, `1` is represented as the island. If two 1 is adjacent, we consider them in the same island. We only consider up/down/left/right adjacent.

Find the number of islands.

### Example

Given graph:

```
[
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
]
```

return `3`.

```python
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    """
    @param grid: a boolean 2D matrix
    @return: an integer
    """
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        # BFS
        # Check input:
        if grid is None or grid == []:
            return 0
        
        res = 0
        for m in range(len(grid)):
            for n in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[m][n] == 1:
                    self.bfs(m, n, grid)
                    res += 1
        return res
        
    def bfs(self, m, n, grid):
        queue = collections.deque()
        queue.append((m, n))
        vector_m = [-1, 0, 1, 0]
        vector_n = [0, -1, 0, 1]
        while queue:
            cur = queue.popleft()
            for i in range(len(vector_m)):
                temp_m = cur[0] + vector_m[i]
                temp_n = cur[1] + vector_n[i]
                # Set the filter before the operation, to avoid too many indentations
                if not (0 <= temp_m < len(grid) and 0 <= temp_n < len(grid[0]) and grid[temp_m][temp_n] == 1):
                    continue
                queue.append((temp_m, temp_n))
                grid[temp_m][temp_n] = 0
```
