### 86. Binary Search Tree Iterator

###hard

Design an iterator over a binary search tree with the following rules:

- Elements are visited in ascending order (i.e. an in-order traversal)
- `next()` and `hasNext()` queries run in O(*1*) time in **average**.

### Example

For the following binary search tree, in-order traversal by using iterator is `[1, 6, 10, 11, 12]`

```
   10
 /    \
1      11
 \       \
  6       12
```

### Challenge

Extra memory usage O(h), h is the height of the tree.

**Super Star**: Extra memory usage O(1)

```python
"""
Definition of TreeNode:
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left, self.right = None, None

Example of iterate a tree:
iterator = BSTIterator(root)
while iterator.hasNext():
    node = iterator.next()
    do something for node

            self.stack.append(node)
            node = node.left

    def next(self, ):
        # Better representation
        node = self.stack.pop() # pop it anyway. don't have to check it twice.
        res = node
        node = node.right
