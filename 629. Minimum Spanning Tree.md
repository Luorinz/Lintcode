### 629. Minimum Spanning Tree

Given a list of Connections, which is the Connection class (the city name at both ends of the edge and a cost between them), find some edges, connect all the cities and spend the least amount.
Return the connects if can connect all the cities, otherwise return empty list.

### Example

Gievn the connections = `["Acity","Bcity",1], ["Acity","Ccity",2], ["Bcity","Ccity",3]`

Return `["Acity","Bcity",1], ["Acity","Ccity",2]`

### Notice

Return the connections sorted by the cost, or sorted city1 name if their cost is same, or sorted city2 if their city1 name is also same.
