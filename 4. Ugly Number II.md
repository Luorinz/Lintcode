### 4. Ugly Number II

###medium

Ugly number is a number that only have factors `2`, `3` and `5`.

Design an algorithm to find the *n*th ugly number. The first 10 ugly numbers are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12...`

### Example

If `n=9`, return `10`.

### Challenge

O(*n* log *n*) or O(*n*) time.

### Notice

Note that `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: An integer
    @return: the nth prime number as description.
    """
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n):
        # Use heap
        import heapq
        heap = [1]
        visited = set([1])
        
        val = None
        for _ in range(n):
            val = heapq.heappop(heap)   # heap is used to find the cur smallest
            # each time, * 2/3/5, thus val contains only 2,3,5 as factors
            for i in [2, 3, 5]: 
                temp = val * i
                if temp not in visited: # Avoid duplicate
                    visited.add(temp)
                    heapq.heappush(heap, temp)
        return val
```
