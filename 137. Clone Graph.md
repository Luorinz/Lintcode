### 137. Clone Graph

###medium

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a `label` and a list of its `neighbors`.

How we serialize an undirected graph:

Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use `#` as a separator for each node, and `,` as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph `{0,1,2#1,2#2,2}`.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by `#`.

1. First node is labeled as `0`. Connect node `0` to both nodes `1` and `2`.
2. Second node is labeled as `1`. Connect node `1` to node `2`.
3. Third node is labeled as `2`. Connect node `2` to node `2` (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:

```
   1
  / \
 /   \
0 --- 2
     / \
     \_/
```

### Example

return a deep copied graph.

```python
from collections import deque
"""
Definition for a undirected graph node
class UndirectedGraphNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.label = x
        self.neighbors = []
"""


class Solution:
    """
    @param: node: A undirected graph node
    @return: A undirected graph node
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.dic = {}   # this dic is used in dfs solution
    
    def cloneGraph_bfs(self, node):
        # BFS
        if node is None:
            return node
        
        # Get all nodes from the old graph(BFS)
        queue = deque()
        queue.append(node)
        nodes = {node}  # Use a set to store nodes to avoid duplicate
        while queue:
            cur_node = queue.popleft()
            for i in cur_node.neighbors:
                if i not in nodes:
                    nodes.add(i)
                    queue.append(i)
                
        # Duplicate the nodes(points) into mapping dic
        mapping = {}
        for i in nodes:
            mapping[i] = UndirectedGraphNode(i.label)
        
        # Store and dupicate the mapping relations(edges)
        for i in nodes:
            for neighbor in i.neighbors:
                cur_node = mapping[i]
                target_node = mapping[neighbor]
                cur_node.neighbors.append(target_node)
                
        return mapping[node]
        
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        # DFS solution
        if node is None:
            return node
        
        # Base case
        # current node is already copied
        if node in self.dic:
            return self.dic[node]
        
        # recursive step
        root = UndirectedGraphNode(node.label)
        self.dic[node] = root
        for neighbor in node.neighbors:
            root.neighbors.append(self.cloneGraph(neighbor))
            
        return root
