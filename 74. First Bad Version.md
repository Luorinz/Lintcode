### 74. First Bad Version

###Medium

The code base version is an integer start from 1 to n. One day, someone committed a bad version in the code case, so it caused this version and the following versions are all failed in the unit tests. Find the first bad version.

You can call `isBadVersion` to help you determine which version is the first bad one. The details interface can be found in the code's annotation part.

### Example

Given n = `5`:

```
isBadVersion(3) -> false
isBadVersion(5) -> true
isBadVersion(4) -> true
```

Here we are 100% sure that the 4th version is the first bad version.

### Challenge

You should call *isBadVersion* as few as possible.

### Notice

Please read the annotation in code area to get the correct way to call isBadVersion in different language. For example, Java is `SVNRepo.isBadVersion(v)`

```python
#class SVNRepo:
#    @classmethod
#    def isBadVersion(cls, id)
#        # Run unit tests to check whether verison `id` is a bad version
#        # return true if unit tests passed else false.
# You can use SVNRepo.isBadVersion(10) to check whether version 10 is a 
# bad version.
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: An integer
    @return: An integer which is the first bad version.
    """
    def findFirstBadVersion(self, n):
        # Use binary search
        start = 1
        end = n
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            if SVNRepo.isBadVersion(mid) is True:
                end = mid
            else:
                start = mid
        if SVNRepo.isBadVersion(start) is True:
            return start
        else:
            return end
```
