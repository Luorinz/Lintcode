###  586. Sqrt(x) II

Implement `double sqrt(double x)` and `x >= 0`.

Compute and return the square root of x.

### Example

Given `n` = `2` return `1.41421356`

### Notice

You do not care about the accuracy of the result, we will help you to output results.

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param x: a double
    @return: the square root of x
    """
    def sqrt(self, x):
        # have to set the upper bound to 1, not x when x<1
        # or the upper bound would never be reached 
        start = 0
        if x < 1:
            end = 1
        else:
            end = x
        while start + 1e-10 < end:
            mid = (start + end) / 2
            if mid * mid == x:
                return mid
            if mid * mid < x:
                start = mid
            else:
                end = mid
        return start
```
