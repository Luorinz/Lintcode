# 477. Surrounded Regions
# Given a 2D board con477. Surrounded Regionstaining 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

# A region is captured by flipping all 'O''s into 'X''s in that surrounded region.

# Example
# X X X X
# X O O X
# X X O X
# X O X X
# After capture all regions surrounded by 'X', the board should be:

# X X X X
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X O X X
