### 127. Topological Sorting

###medium

Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:

- For each directed edge `A -> B` in graph, A must before B in the order list.
- The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.

Find any topological order for the given graph.

### Example

For graph as follow:

The topological order can be:

```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[0, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
...
```

### Challenge

Can you do it in both BFS and DFS?

### Clarification

[Learn more about representation of graphs](http://www.lintcode.com/help/graph)

### Notice

You can assume that there is at least one topological order in the graph.
