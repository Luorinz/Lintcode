### 608. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

###easy

Given an array of integers that is already *sorted in ascending order*, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

### Example

Given nums = `[2, 7, 11, 15]`, target = `9`
return `[1, 2]`

### Notice

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param nums: an array of Integer
    @param target: target = nums[index1] + nums[index2]
    @return: [index1 + 1, index2 + 1] (index1 < index2)
    """
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        # double pointers
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            if nums[left] + nums[right] < target:
                left += 1
            elif nums[left] + nums[right] > target:
                right -= 1
            else:
                return [left + 1, right + 1]
        
```
