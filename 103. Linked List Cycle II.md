### 103. Linked List Cycle II

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins.

If there is no cycle, return `null`.

### Example

Given `-21->10->4->5`, tail connects to node index 1，return `10`
Explanation：
The last node 5 points to the node whose index is 1, which is 10, so the entrance of the ring is 10

### Challenge

Follow up:

Can you solve it without using extra space?

```python
"""
Definition of ListNode
class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
"""

class Solution:
    """
    @param head: The first node of linked list.
    @return: The node where the cycle begins. if there is no cycle, return null
    """
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        # O1 space 
        # double ptrs
        if not head or not head.next:
            return None
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
            if slow == fast:
                break
        # need to draw a pic to illustrate
        if slow == fast:
            slow = head
            while slow != fast:
                slow = slow.next
                fast = fast.next
            return slow
        return None
```
