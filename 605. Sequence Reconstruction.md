### 605. Sequence Reconstruction

###medium

Check whether the original sequence `org` can be uniquely reconstructed from the sequences in `seqs`. The org sequence is a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. Reconstruction means building a shortest common supersequence of the sequences in `seqs` (i.e., a shortest sequence so that all sequences in `seqs` are subsequences of it). Determine whether there is only one sequence that can be reconstructed from `seqs` and it is the `org` sequence.

### Example

```
Given org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2],[1,3]]
Return false
Explanation:
[1,2,3] is not the only one sequence that can be reconstructed, because [1,3,2] is also a valid sequence that can be reconstructed.

Given org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2]]
Return false
Explanation:
The reconstructed sequence can only be [1,2].

Given org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Return true
Explanation:
The sequences [1,2], [1,3], and [2,3] can uniquely reconstruct the original sequence [1,2,3].

Given org = [4,1,5,2,6,3], seqs = [[5,2,6,3],[4,1,5,2]]
Return true
```
