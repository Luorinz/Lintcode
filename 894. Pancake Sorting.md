### 894. Pancake Sorting

Given an an `unsorted array`, sort the given array. You are allowed to do only following operation on array.

```
flip(arr, i): Reverse array from 0 to i 
```

Unlike a traditional sorting algorithm, which attempts to sort with the fewest comparisons possible, the goal is to sort the sequence in as few reversals as possible.

### Example

Given array = `[6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 20, 23]`
Use `flip(arr, i)` function to sort the array.

### Notice

You only call `flip` function.
Don't allow to use any sort function or other sort methods.

Javaï¼šyou can call `FlipTool.flip(arr, i)`
C++ï¼š you can call `FlipTool::flip(arr, i)`
Python2&3 you can call `FlipTool.flip(arr, i)`

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param array: an integer array
    @return: nothing
    """
    def pancakeSort(self, array):
        # On2 time, reverse sort
        if not array:
            return
        i = j = len(array) - 1
        while i>0 :
            j = i
            while j >0:
                if array[j] > array[0]:
                    FlipTool.flip(array, j)
                j -= 1
            FlipTool.flip(array, i)
            i -= 1

```
