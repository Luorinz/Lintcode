### 488. Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is *happy*.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

### Example

Example 1:

```
Input:19
Output:true
Explanation:

19 is a happy number

    1^2 + 9^2 = 82
    8^2 + 2^2 = 68
    6^2 + 8^2 = 100
    1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input:5
Output:false
Explanation:

5 is not a happy number

25->29->85->89->145->42->20->4->16->37->58->89
89 appears again.
```



```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: An integer
    @return: true if this is a happy number or false
    """
    def isHappy(self, n):
        memo = set()
        self.helper(n, memo)
        print(memo)
        return 1 in memo
    
    def helper(self, n, memo):
        if n in memo:
            return
        memo.add(n)
        cur = str(n)
        temp = 0
        for i in cur:
            temp += int(i) * int(i)

        self.helper(temp, memo)
```
