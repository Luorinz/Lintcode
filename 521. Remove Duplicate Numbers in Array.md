###  521. Remove Duplicate Numbers in Array

###easy

Given an array of integers, remove the duplicate numbers in it.

You should:

1. Do it in place in the array.
2. Move the unique numbers to the front of the array.
3. Return the total number of the unique numbers.

### Example

Given *nums* = `[1,3,1,4,4,2]`, you should:

1. Move duplicate integers to the tail of *nums* => *nums* = `[1,3,4,2,?,?]`.
2. Return the number of unique integers in *nums* => `4`.

Actually we don't care about what you place in `?`, we only care about the part which has no duplicate integers.

### Challenge

1. Do it in O(n) time complexity.
2. Do it in O(nlogn) time without extra space.

### Notice

You don't need to keep the original order of the integers.

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param nums: an array of integers
    @return: the number of unique integers
    """
    def deduplication1(self, nums):
        # Hash table solution
        # O(n) time O(n) space
        dic = set()
        ind = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num not in dic:
                dic.add(num)
                nums[ind] = num
                ind += 1
        return ind
    
    def deduplication(self, nums):
        # Double pointer solution
        # O(nlogn) time O(1) space
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
            
        new_ind = 1
        nums.sort()
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Compare it with previous one
            # if not duplicate, add it to the new array
            # else pass it until there's a different one
            if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
                nums[new_ind] = nums[i]
                new_ind += 1
        return new_ind
```
