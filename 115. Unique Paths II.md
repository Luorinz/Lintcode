### 115. Unique Paths II

###medium

Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

### Example

For example,

There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

```
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
```

The total number of unique paths is `2`.

### Notice

*m* and *n* will be at most 100.

```python
class Solution_1:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        dic = {}
        for i in range(len(obstacleGrid)):
            for j in range(len(obstacleGrid[i])):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] != 0:
                    dic[(i, j)] = 0
                    continue 
                if i== 0 and j == 0:
                    dic[(i, j)] = 1
                elif i == 0:
                    dic[(i, j)] = dic[(i,j-1)]
                elif j ==0:
                    dic[(i, j)] = dic[(i-1, j)]
                else:
                    dic[(i, j)] = dic[(i-1, j)] + dic[(i, j-1)]
        return dic[(i, j)]

class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        dic = {(0, 0) : 1}
        for i in range(len(obstacleGrid)):
            for j in range(len(obstacleGrid[i])):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] != 0:
                    dic[(i, j)] = 0
                    continue
                if i != 0 or j != 0:    # filter
                    dic[(i,j)] = dic.get((i-1, j), 0) + dic.get((i, j-1), 0)
        return dic[(i, j)]
```
